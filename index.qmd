## The `report_final_v3_FINAL.docx` Problem

Have you ever experienced a situation like this?

> You're writing a report with colleagues. You start with `report.docx` and email it to your supervisor for comments. They return `report_with_corrections.docx`. Meanwhile, you've made more changes, creating `report_v2.docx`, and emailed it to a collaborator to add their section. You try to incorporate the supervisor's suggestions from `report_with_corrections.docx` into `report_v2.docx`, creating `report_v3.docx`. Then your supervisor sends `report_with_corrections_more.docx` and your collaborator returns `report_v2_my_additions.docx`.

This scenario illustrates several common problems with ad-hoc collaboration:

- **No single source of truth**: Which version is the "correct" one?
- **Lost work**: Changes made in one version may not make it into another
- **Confusion**: Who made which changes and when?
- **Merge nightmares**: Manually combining changes is error-prone and time-consuming
- **Versioning chaos**: Filenames become increasingly absurd

## Git as a Single Source of Truth

Git and GitHub solve these problems by providing a **single source of truth** — a central repository that contains the authoritative version of your project. All collaborators work on their own local copies, make changes, and synchronise those changes through the central repository.

This approach provides:

- **Clear history**: Every change is tracked with who made it and why
- **No lost work**: All changes are preserved in the version history
- **Safe experimentation**: Work can happen in parallel without interfering
- **Automatic merging**: Git handles most merge scenarios automatically
- **Conflict resolution tools**: When conflicts occur, Git helps you resolve them


## Intended learning outcomes

By the end of this course, you will:

- Apply GitHub Flow for team collaboration
- Create and manage feature branches effectively
- Write clear, focused Pull Requests
- Conduct constructive code reviews
- Resolve merge conflicts confidently
- Implement branch protection rules for code quality
