## Writing Effective Pull Requests

A Pull Request (PR) is more than just code — it's communication with your team. A good PR makes reviewing easier and faster.

Follow these tips to write effective pull requests:

**1. Clear, Descriptive Title**

❌ Bad: "Updates"  
❌ Bad: "Fix bug"  
✅ Good: "Add power function for exponent calculations"  
✅ Good: "Fix division by zero error in calculator"

**2. Comprehensive Description**

Use a template:

```markdown
## Purpose
Brief explanation of why this change is needed.

## Changes
- Bullet list of what was changed
- Include files modified and what was done

## Testing
How you verified the changes work correctly.

## Screenshots (if applicable)
Visual changes should include before/after images.

## Related Issues
Closes #123
Relates to #456
```

**3. Small, Focused Changes**

- One feature or fix per Pull Request
- Aim for under 400 lines of changes
- If it's getting large, consider breaking it into multiple PRs


**4. Self-Review First**

Before requesting review:

- Review your own code on GitHub
- Check for debugging code or comments to remove
- Verify tests pass
- Ensure code follows project style guidelines

### A Good Pull Request

#### Title
Add modulo operation to calculator library

#### Purpose
Users need to calculate remainders in division operations. This adds modulo functionality to support use cases like determining odd/even numbers or circular buffer indexing.

#### Changes
- Added `modulo(a, b)` function to `calc_lib.py`
- Added unit tests in `test_calc.py`
- Updated `README.md` with usage examples
- Updated `calc_demo.py` to demonstrate modulo operation
 
#### Testing
- All existing tests pass
- New tests cover positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero divisor
- Manually verified examples in README
 
#### Notes
Raises `ValueError` when divisor is zero, consistent with existing `divide()` function behaviour.

## Code Review Best Practices

Code review is a skill that requires practice. Good reviews improve code quality while maintaining team morale.

### For Reviewers: How to Review Constructively

**1. Be Kind and Respectful**  
Frame feedback constructively:

❌ "This code is terrible"  
✅ "This could be more efficient using a list comprehension"

**2. Distinguish Between Issues and Suggestions**  
Clarify what's required vs optional:

- **Must fix**: "This will cause a bug with negative input"
- **Should consider**: "Consider extracting this into a separate function"
- **Nice to have**: "Descriptive variable names improve readability"

**3. Provide Specific, Actionable Feedback**  
❌ Vague: "This function needs work"  
✅ Specific: "Add a check for None values at line 42."

**4. Praise Good Work**  
Acknowledge positives:

- "Nice solution to this edge case!"
- "Great test coverage!"

**5. Review the Right Things**  
Focus on:

- **Correctness**: Does it work?
- **Design**: Is it maintainable?
- **Tests**: Are they adequate?
- **Documentation**: Are changes documented?

Avoid:

- Personal style preferences (use automated formatters instead)
- Trivial spacing issues (use linters instead)

### For Authors: Receiving Feedback Gracefully

**1. Don't Take It Personally**  
Reviews critique code, not you.

**2. Ask Questions**  
If unclear: "Could you clarify 'more robust error handling'?"

**3. Discuss, Don't Argue**  
Explain your reasoning respectfully if you disagree.

**4. Thank Reviewers**  
"Thanks for catching that!" acknowledges their effort.
