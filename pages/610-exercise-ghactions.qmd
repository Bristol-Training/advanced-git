title: ":: Exercise 3"
---

In this exercise we'll add automated testing to the statistics library using GitHub Actions. This ensures all future pull requests are automatically tested before merging.


## Part 1: Understanding the Current Tests

**Step 1**: Explore the existing test file

Open `test_stats_lib.py` in your repository. You'll see pytest tests for the statistics functions.

**Step 2**: Run tests locally

```bash
# Run the tests
pytest test_stats_lib.py

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=stats_lib test_stats_lib.py
```

You should see all tests pass with the merged code from the previous exercises.

## Part 2: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow

The **Repository Owner** leads this part, but everyone should follow along in their own clone.

**Step 1**: Create the workflow directory structure

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

**Step 2**: Create the workflow file

Create the workflow file `.github/workflows/pytest.yml`. You can use the workflow in <https://github.com/Bristol-Training/demo-calc-lib> as a template.


**Step 3**: Ensure `requirements.txt` exists

If it doesn't exist, create it. Since this is a simple library, the file might be minimal or empty, but it should exist for the workflow.

**Step 4**: Commit and push

```bash
git add .github/workflows/pytest.yml
git add requirements.txt  # if you created it
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing"
git push origin main
```

**Step 5**: Verify the workflow runs

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. You should see your workflow running (yellow circle) or completed (green checkmark)
4. Click on the workflow run to see detailed logs

✅ **Automated testing is now active!**

## Part 3: Test the Workflow with a Pull Request

Now let's see GitHub Actions in action by creating a pull request with failing tests.

**Step 1**: Create a buggy branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/buggy-median
```

**Step 2**: Introduce a bug in `stats_lib.py`

Find the `median` function and change it to:

```python
def median(data):
    """Calculate median (with an intentional bug)."""
    clean_data = [x for x in data if x is not None]
    
    if not clean_data:
        raise ValueError("No valid data points")
    
    sorted_data = sorted(clean_data)
    n = len(sorted_data)
    
    # BUG: Wrong calculation!
    return sorted_data[0]  # Always returns the first element
```

**Step 3**: Commit and push (without testing locally!)

```bash
git add stats_lib.py
git commit -m "Update median calculation"
git push origin feature/buggy-median
```

**Step 4**: Create Pull Request

1. Create the pull request on GitHub
2. Watch the checks run
3. Notice the **red X** ❌ 
4. Click "Details" to see which test failed
5. The PR shows "Some checks were not successful"

**Step 5**: Fix the bug

```bash
# Fix the median function back to correct implementation
git add stats_lib.py
git commit -m "Fix median calculation"
git push origin feature/buggy-median
```

**Step 6**: Create Pull Request

1. Go to GitHub and create a pull request
2. Notice the **yellow circle** appears next to your PR - checks are running!
3. Wait for it to turn into a **green checkmark** ✅
4. The PR shows "All checks have passed"

**Repository Owner can merge this PR with confidence!**
